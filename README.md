## What's m6A-Maize
m6A-Maize is a centralized online platform for predicting the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) degree of mRNA and the SNP-related traits in Maize(Zea Mays). 

This publicly available repository is for the purpose of publicly building the code used to build the website, so that users can more easily find and report problems with the website, and provide a similar reference model for building an online platform for bioinformatics tools.

## Starting to use m6A-Maize
